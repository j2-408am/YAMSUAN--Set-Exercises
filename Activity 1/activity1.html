        <p id="main">If you're into anime, you may be familiar with this famous Japanese food. Onigiri or Japanese rice balls is a staple food that is fun and easy to make! Though tuna and mayonnaise is the usual filling inside these rice balls,
            you can put almost anything inside such as grilled salmon, pickled plums, beef, pork or turkey. I'd like to share with you my favorite recipe made by Mei & Kyong.

        <h2>Method for Molding Onigiri With Molder:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place half a sheet of nori, shiny side down, and place the tip of the triangle mold at the center of the top edge of the seaweed. 
                Add enough rice into the mold to cover the bottom, about ¼ to ⅓ cup of rice. 
                Spread the seasoned rice as evenly as possible on the bottom and slightly up the sides of the mold to form a little "bowl."</li>
                <br>
            <li>Place about one tablespoon of the spicy mayo tuna in the center and cover the top with about the same amount of rice as the bottom, about ¼ to ⅓ cup. 
                Spread out the rice if need be, then use the press to firmly and evenly press down the onigiri. 
                Keep the pressure on the press and pull the triangle mold up to release the mold.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Fold the bottom half of the nori over the onigiri and fold the corners down to adhere. Set aside and repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        </ol>
