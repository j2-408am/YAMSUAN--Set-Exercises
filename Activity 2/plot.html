            <p class="film">THE DEAD POETS<br>SOCIETY</p>
            <h1>PLOT</h1>
            <p class="info">Dead Poets Society (1989), directed by Peter Weir, is a coming-of-age film where a new English teacher changed the lives of a group of young boys. Set in 1959, A prestigious academy called "Welton Academy" is an all-boys prep school known for its strict rules and traditional values. 
                One day, a new English teacher was introduced to the class. His name is Mr. John Keating. He’s different from their other teachers—he doesn’t just teach them poetry, he teaches them to think for themselves and live life to the fullest. His motto is <i><b>“Carpe Diem,”</i></b>which means<i><b>“seize the day.”</i></b>
                <br><br>Inspired by Mr. Keating, a few of the boys—especially Neil Perry, Todd Anderson, Knox Overstreet, and others—reform a secret group called the <i>Dead Poets Society.</i> 
                They meet in a cave to read poetry and talk about their dreams. For many of them, this is the first time they feel free to express themselves.
                <br><br>Neil, one of the main characters, wants to become an actor, but his strict father wants him to be a doctor. Neil gets a part in a school play, but when his dad finds out, he forces him to quit acting and tries to send him to military school. 
                Feeling hopeless and trapped, Neil ends up taking his own life. After Neil’s death, the school investigates what happened and ends up blaming Mr. Keating for influencing him too much. 
                He gets fired from his job. In the final scene, as Mr. Keating is leaving the classroom for the last time, the students show their respect by standing on their desks and calling out, <i><b>“O Captain! My Captain!”</i></b>—a line from a poem he taught them.
