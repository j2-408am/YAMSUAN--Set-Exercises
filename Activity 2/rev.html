            <p class="info">The Dead Poets Society is a 1989 coming-of-age drama by Peter Weir, following a group of students and their new teacher. 
                It is a charming and poetic film set in the autumn of 1959 at the fictional Welton Academy for boys, which received Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Director, BAFTA Awards for Best Film and Best Music. 
                The story is both humorous and heartwarming.<br>
                <br>John Keating, played by Robin Williams, is a new English literature teacher at a prestigious American college known for its ancient traditions and high standards. He stands out from the traditional teachers with his easy-going demeanor, 
                eccentric behavior, and disregard for the curriculum. One day, he reveals the secret of the Dead Poets Society to his students. Neil Perry, Todd Anderson, and others, with Keating's help, try to find their own voice in a faceless choir. 
                They learn to see the world around them by leaping over the gray school fence.<br>
                <br>The cast of the film is exceptional, with Robin Williams, Josh Charles, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, Norman Lloyd, and others, with Williams delivering a standout performance as John Keating.
                Williams' portrayal is full of humor, warmth, and depth. The visual design is cozy, and the atmosphere is warm. In conclusion, Dead Poets Society is one of the best films I have ever seen.<br>
                <br>The movie masterfully conveys the beauty of poetry, showing how words can have profound meaning and transform the soul. The story teaches us to break free from our limitations and pursue our dreams. 
                And remember: "Carpe diem! Seize the day! Make your lives extraordinary!"

            <p class="info">I feel that in any film there are some mistakes. A great performance by Robin Williams was incredible, and I'm going to let myself be carried away by the sentimental side of my heart. 
                As I go through moments that are really similar to Neil in relation to his relationship with his father, I feel close to him. 
                His choice of ending reminds me that I, too, have already decided that; but unlike him, I am a coward who is afraid to face the consequences. 
                This makes me wonder what my soul feels.

            <p class="info">All Time Classic. The editing is really good and even though it does jump a little bit when focusing on the boys individual stories it works very well as when they come together
                they are changed and different each time. The music is really good also though the only complaint I have is it wasn't used enough in the first half especially and this can have a dry feeling throughout most of the runtime.
                That being said everything else is pretty much flawless. The acting is top notch across the board. Each of the Boys have defined characteristics, acted extremely well, and most importantly never blend in and are super likeable.<br>
                <br>Williams is incredible and the best thing in this. The camerawork, settings, and scenes with Williams teaching are masterfully done. This is very sincere, heartbreaking, and inspiring at the same time. 
                This a wonderful coming of age story. Anyone should see this once.
